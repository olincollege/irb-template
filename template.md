## 14. Informed Consent

The _Belmont Report_ identifies informed consent as the primary way that the
principle of Respect for Persons is applied in the conduct of ethical human
subjects research. Consent can be obtained in multiple ways, depending on the
methods of your study, the subjects involved, and the data being collected:

- **Standard informed consent** requires a legal signature (to document
- **Waivers of documented informed consent** are available if your subjects are
  unable to legally sign, provided certain conditions are met.
- **Alterations to informed consent** are available, as well, if you do not plan
  to use all [elements of informed
  consent](https://www.brandeis.edu/ora/hrpp/special-topics/consent/elements-informed-consent.html);
  however, stringent conditions must be met.
- **Complete waivers of informed consent** are available if the subjects will
  not be consented at all; however, once again, stringent conditions must be
  met.

We have developed a set of questions below that walk you through your options.
Remember, obtaining informed consent is a continuous process throughout your
interactions with your subjects, not just a moment in time through obtaining a
signature on a form. When using consent procedures, a copy of all
consent/assent/study information documents must be made available to
participants to keep.

Answer the following questions for each cohort of adult subjects (e.g.,
interview vs focus group vs survey)

Describe this cohort of adult subjects (e.g., they will participate in
interviews): (fill in)

Will this cohort of adult subjects undergo informed consent procedures?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

If you select "No" above: You are requesting a complete waiver of informed
consent. Note that all five of the following conditions must be met (please
check all that apply):

- [ ] The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver.
- [ ] The research involves no more than minimal risk to the adult subjects.
- [ ] The waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the adult subjects.
- [ ] All data will be de-identified, OR research could not practicably be
  carried out without using identifiable private information or biospecimens.
- [ ] The adult subjects will be provided with additional pertinent
  information/debriefed after participation (e.g., if deception or incomplete
  disclosure is being used), OR debriefing is not appropriate.

Explain your need for a complete waiver of informed consent: (fill in)

Attach final versions (as they appear to your adult subjects - e.g., with
graphics/letterhead and without extraneous text) of informed consent/assent
forms, information sheets, computer consent screens, consent/assent scripts,
etc.

(Upload here - for Qualtrics, screenshots or a reasonably complete description
is okay.)
Please make a copy of the Informed Consent Form available to participants to keep.
_Please make a copy of the Informed Consent Form available to participants to
keep._

## 15. Study Description

Describe your research plan, including the procedures, steps, and actions you

locked file cabinet, on Box.com) and data analysis (e.g., on Box.com).

(fill in)

Describe how and at what point the research data will be de-identified (e.g.,
when the master list is destroyed). If research data will not be de-identified,
explain why. Note that data are not de-identified if linked in any way to the
subjects - coded data are not de-identified data.

(fill in)

Describe when and how the research data will be destroyed (e.g., scrubbing
computer files). If the research data will be stored indefinitely, describe how
you will continue to keep them secure (e.g., data repository). Note that data

## 18. Additional Comments

(If you need to explain anything to the IRB, do it here. They are generally very
understanding and willing to work with you, such as if you mention that certain
things are in draft form or that you will add a collaborator in the near
future.)

Attach any other supporting documents not already attached.

(Upload if needed)

## Statement of Assurance

My signature below indicates that the information provided in this protocol is
correct and that I agree to comply with all federal, state, and institutional
policies and procedures designed to protect human subjects in research. My
signature also acknowledges my understanding of my responsibilities as a
research investigator, as outlined below and in Brandeis University's
Federalwide Assurance.

- I acknowledge and accept the responsibility for protecting the rights and
  welfare of human research subjects and for complying with all applicable
  provisions of the Brandeis University Federalwide Assurance.
- I will provide a copy of the IRB-approved informed consent document to each
  subject at the time of consent, unless the IRB has specifically waived this
  requirement. All signed consent documents are to be retained in a manner
  approved by the IRB.
- I will request review by the IRB for any proposed changes in previously
  approved human subject research. The proposed changes will not be initiated
  without IRB review and approval, except where necessary to eliminate apparent
  immediate hazards to the subjects.
- I will report progress of approved research as often as and in the manner
  prescribed by the IRB.
- I will promptly report to the IRB any injuries or other unanticipated problems
  involving risks to subjects or others.
- No research investigator who is obligated by the provisions of this Assurance,
  any associated Inter-Institutional Amendment, or Noninstitutional Investigator
  Agreement will seek to obtain research credit for, or use data from, patient
  interventions that constitute the provision of emergency medical care without
  prior IRB approval. A physician may provide emergency medical care to a
  patient without prior IRB review and approval, to the extent permitted by law,
  however such activities may not be counted as research nor the data used in
  support of research.
- I will advise the IRB, Office of Research Administration, and the appropriate
  officials of other institutions of the intent to admit human subjects who are
  involved in research protocols for which this Assurance or any related
  Inter-Institutional Amendment or Noninstitutional Investigator Agreement
  applies. When such admission is planned or a frequent occurrence, those
  institutions must possess an applicable OHRP-approved Assurance prior to
  involvement of such persons as human subjects in those research protocols.
